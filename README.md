Useful Lualine Components I use

Right now there are two LuaLine Components in this plugin:

localMarks: 
This components tells you what local marks are set. 
You can configure what the prefix is, what marks it tracks, and what the delimiter is.

globalMarks:
This components tells you what global marks are set. 
You can configure what the prefix is, what marks it tracks, and what the delimiter is.
